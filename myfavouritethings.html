      <h2>Video Editing:</h2>

      <p class="ptext">Personally, I think video editing is fun to do and very cool, but it can get very tiring when staring at a screen for like 1 - 2+ hours straight. (Image by me)</p>

      <p class="ptext">I love watching videos, personally I more so like those apple videos, but now, I also like watching  GTA V gameplay videos. My favourite tv shows to watch on Netflix is Brooklyn 99, and Modern family, to the point I started to re watch it over and over again.</p>

      <img src="csgo.png"  width="800" height="420">
      <p class="ptext">I don't really play games as much as other boys do, trust me I am not a gamer. The only games I see myself playing if I'm on a PC, is Watch Dogs, and maybe GTA V. Those are the only 2 games I like to play, I also somewhat like CS GO and Rocket League.</p>
